My name is Joris van der Lugt I am a Master student following the Toxicology and Environmental Health master. 
I am working on a research project in which I script reverse dosimetry PBPK models for ‘difficult-to-test’ chemicals to assess the extent to which alternative in vitro dosing techniques improve quantitative in vitro in vivo extrapolations (QIVIVE) of chemicals that evaporate, degrade or non-specifically bind to well plate plastic and medium constituents in vitro.
My bachelor was biology here at university Utrecht. During my bachelor I was primarily focused on molecular biology. This will be my major internship project. I have already completed my minor internship at TNO on the toxicology of firearm emissions. 
I will be doing my internship part time for 16 hours a week. The remaining time will be spent teaching biology at the Dutch Defense CBRN center in Vught. Apart from this teaching job and internship I enjoy hiking and can often be found at the Survivalbaan at USSV Simius Hircus
